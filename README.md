# Machine_Learning stuff
This repo is a collection of Python code utilizing nothing more than numpy and pandas to perform the following Neural network training techiques:
 - Backpropogation
 - Evolutionary algorithm, both with and without separate weights for each layer of the neural network
 - Genetic evolution to identify the most important 10% of the weights
 - Swarm Optimization
 - Differential Evolution
